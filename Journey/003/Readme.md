## Introduction

Today I am going to talk a little bit about IAM and what I learned about it.

## Use Case

Restricting or allowing users/groups/services to only what they need access within a VPC. Important for security reasons, don't want anyone doing what they're not supposed to be.

## Cloud Research

I learned how to make users and give them permissions individually or add them to a group and grant access that way. I also learned that for services to talk to each other they need to have certain permissions set which can also be done the same way you would add permissions to a user or group. New users also have a special login link when accessing a VPC. A lot of the controls found in IAM are pretty similar to what a SysAdmin would use to manage users and groups in something like Windows Server.

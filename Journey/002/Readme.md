# AWS Basics

## Cloud Research

Learned about some very basic terminology and why a business or individual would want to use a cloud provider such as AWS.

### Personal use

For personal use someone may want to use AWS to back up their files. Instead of it being on their computer which could fail they could instead upload it to AWS and access it from any device they wanted to.

### Enterprise use

To scale manually and stand servers up is very costly and time consuming and very prone to errors. One downfall would be over-estimating growth but planning for it and having servers sit around without ever using them. It might be good to have just in case but essentially they're burning money. AWS solves this by automatically scaling or removing resources automatically, that way you only use what you need.

### Terminology

- High Availability: systems that are able available around the clock with little to no interruptions
- Fault Tolerant: in the event of a failure a system is still able to operate 
- Scalability: being able to add resources as the demand increases
- Elasticity: being able to grow or shrink resource needs depending traffic
